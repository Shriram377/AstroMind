      },
      {
        "question": "What is Stellar Nucleosynthesis?",
        "answer": "Stellar nucleosynthesis is the process by which stars produce new, heavier elements by fusing lighter atomic nuclei. In stars like our Sun, this is primarily the proton-proton chain that fuses hydrogen into helium. In more massive stars, the CNO cycle and later, the alpha process, create elements up to iron."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the Chandrasekhar Limit?",
        "answer": "This is a critical threshold in stellar evolution, the maximum mass for a stable, non-rotating white dwarf star, approximately 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. If a white dwarf exceeds this mass, the electron degeneracy pressure can no longer support it against gravity, leading to a catastrophic Type Ia supernova."

        "answer": "These are rotating structures of gas and dust that surround a central body, like a newly forming star, a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole. The material spirals inward due to gravity while friction and tidal forces heat it, causing it to emit powerful radiation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)?",
        "answer": "A quasar is an extremely luminous and distant active galactic nucleus. They are powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, which are actively accreting vast amounts of matter. The intense gravitational energy of the black hole is converted into light, making quasars some of the brightest objects in the universe."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Gravitational Lensing?",
        "answer": "This phenomenon occurs when a massive object, like a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies, bends the light from a more distant object behind it. The gravity acts like a lens, distorting the image of the background object into arcs or multiple images."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)?",
        "answer": "The CMB is a faint, uniform glow of microwave radiation that fills all of space. It is the oldest light in the universe, a fossil from about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the universe cooled enough for photons to travel freely for the first time."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between Cosmological Redshift and Doppler Redshift?",
        "answer": "Doppler redshift is caused by the motion of a source through space. Cosmological redshift, on the other hand, is caused by the expansion of space itself. As space expands, the wavelengths of light traveling through it are stretched, shifting the light toward the red end of the spectrum."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are Dark Matter and Dark Energy?",
        "answer": "Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit or interact with light. Its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on galaxies. Dark energy is an even more mysterious force thought to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between the Observable Universe and the Universe?",
        "answer": "The observable universe is the portion of the universe that is accessible to us from Earth's position in spacetime, as the light from more distant objects has not had enough time to reach us. The entire universe is thought to be much larger, possibly infinite."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Inflationary Cosmology?",

        "answer": "Also known as the \"Goldilocks Zone,\" this is the region around a star where the temperature is just right for liquid water to exist on a planet's surface. A planet in this zone, with an atmosphere and other key conditions, could potentially support life."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are some Exoplanet Detection Methods?",
        "answer": "The two most common are the transit method (detecting a slight dip in a star's brightness as a planet passes in front of it) and the radial velocity method (detecting a star's tiny gravitational \"wobble\" caused by an orbiting planet)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Escape Velocity?",
        "answer": "This is the minimum speed needed for an object to escape the gravitational pull of a celestial body without any further propulsion. For Earth, this speed is about 11.2 km/s."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Tidal Locking?",
        "answer": "This occurs when a celestial body's orbital period matches its rotational period, causing the same side of the body to always face its gravitational partner. Our Moon is tidally locked with Earth, which is why we only ever see one side of it."
      },

      },
      {
        "question": "What is Orbital Resonance?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What is Hawking Radiation?",
        "answer": "This theoretical phenomenon suggests that black holes are not completely \"black\" but can emit thermal radiation. It is a quantum mechanical effect at the event horizon, where particle-antiparticle pairs are created, and one particle escapes while the other falls in."
